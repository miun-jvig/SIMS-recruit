        profile, grade the CV on a scale from 1 to 5, where 1 fits the least and 5 fits the most. If you are not
        certain how to grade, then use these guidelines for the grade: \n\n Grade 1: The applicant is missing the
        needed education. \n Grade 2: The applicant has the right education, but have not worked with equivalent job
        tasks. \n Grade 3: The applicant has the right education and has worked with similar job tasks. They also
        have some required qualifications. \n Grade 4: The applicant has the right education and has worked with
        similar job tasks. They also have almost all required qualifications. \n Grade 5: The applicant meets all
        previous grades. The applicant has also worked in the same job role for some years, or alternatively has
        extensive experience and fills all the qualifications."""
